/**
 * Let's create some objects!
 *
 * Define a an object below with the name "LivingThing".
 * Give the object a constructor that takes two properties called "name" and "health".
 *
 * Once you have your object defined, let's create some living things.
 * Create three LivingThing instances from your object, one for each of the creatures below.
 * Be sure to set each object's name and health!
 *
 * name: "Rat"
 * health: 5
 *
 * name: "Goblin"
 * health: 30
 *
 * name: "Ogre"
 * health: 80
 *
 * Finally, add each of your objects to an array called "monsters"
 *
 * Use the following function documentation if you need a refresher on how objects with constructors are defined:
 * @see https://css-tricks.com/understanding-javascript-constructors/#article-header-id-1
